How to increase the communication between payment and facilitation apps.

- Use intents to list apps capable of taking payments and facilitating payments like splitting the bill
- Define a MIME Type for the exchange of payment request and response data

To install
- ChickenShop app. This app is the co-ordinator and controls the settling of the bill. It lists apps that can help settle the bill
- PayBuddy app. This can be used to pay all or some of the bill
- CommunityGiver app. This can be used to add money to the bill in the form of a charity donation
- SplitBill. This can be used to cut down the total into smaller payable amounts
